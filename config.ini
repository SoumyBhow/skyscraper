; This is an example config file for use with Skyscraper. Use it as a template for creating
;   your own. If you copy this file to 'config.ini' it will be used by default.
;   You can always copy config.ini.example to a filename of your choice and make Skyscraper
;   use it with the '-c CONFIGFILE' command line option.

; You can have several platform sections in one config file. Further down is an example of
;   a generic platform setup. Check '--help' for more info on supported platforms.

; You can have several scraping module sections in one config file. Further down is an example
;   of a generic module setup. Check '--help' for more info on supported modules.

; Remember that most of these settings can also be set as command line options. Doing so
;   will overrule the options seen here except for the scraping module configs which
;   overrules everything else.
; Platform specific configs overrule main configs.

; Uncomment the lines you wish to use (remove the ';' in front of the lines).
; Also remember to uncomment or create the sections they belong to such as '[snes]'.
