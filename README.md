# üè¢Skyscraper

Script to install [Skycraper](https://github.com/gemba/skyscraper) on Android Termux

This project makes use of [Gemba's](https://github.com/gemba) fork.

Original project by [Lars Muldjord](https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper)

A powerful and versatile yet easy to use game scraper written in C++ for use with multiple frontends running on a Linux system (macOS and Windows too, but not officially supported). It scrapes and caches various game resources from various scraping sources, including media such as screenshot, cover and video. It then gives you the option to generate a game list and artwork for the chosen frontend by combining all of the cached resources.

All Skyscraper features are [well-documented](https://github.com/gemba/skyscraper/tree/master/docs) and there's also a [F.A.Q](https://github.com/gemba/skyscraper/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).

For more details of the project, please visit the [repo](https://github.com/gemba/skyscraper).
